If you want to full understand the system,
learn about Fedora at

There are all kinds of hidden gems that you will likely
not find without reading through the full documentation. These are little
improvements and performance tricks I have learned over the years.

Other questions
---------------

### I don't like Fedora. Is it available on another distro?

The only official release is based on Fedora, but you can follow the
instructions for any Linux distribution, but with some tweaks.
Each distribution will have different package managers and package
names. Some distributions may not have certain applications available in
their repositories or they may be older versions. There's no guarantee
every step will be exact, but you can attempt to recreate every customization
in your favorite distro like Arch Linux or Debian.

### Can I undo any of the customizations I don't want?

### How do I upgrade?

### Can I run it as a LiveCD?

### Can I run install directly on my hardware?


### Why Fedora?

Fedora was chosen as a base system because:

- It is will supported and has committed backing
- Proven to be stable
- Does not include any non-free software in standard repos
- Does provide proprietary software repos by explict opt-in
- Knowledge transfers well to CentOS or Fedora Server for servers
- Wide support of RPM packaging.

#### Why not Debian?

Debian is great for being a stable platform that has a strong stance
against non-free software. However, the packages get stale and the release
cycle is slow. Fedora has a similar philosophy on proprietary software,
but has a much faster release cycle and includes newer versions.

#### Why not Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is an amazing distribution if you accept the proprietary software
that come with it. Fedora provides proprietary software packages if you
opt-in, but

#### Why not Arch Linux?

This project is used to manage the Fedora kickstart
files used in composing Fedora release images. 

The master branch is used by rawhide and each 
release branch is used by that release. 

Changes should be made to rawhide first, then 
cherry-picked back to any release branches that require 
it. 

All changes should be made via the PR workflow. 

This project is packaged in Fedora as the 
spin-kickstarts package allowing users to see
and modify the kickstart files for their local needs. 

To make a release: 

git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/spin-kickstarts.git spin-kickstarts
cd spin-kickstarts
# If you need a specific branch other than master:
git checkout BRANCHNAME
# No tag has been added yet tag HEAD with
git tag VERSION
git push --tags
make
# Publish the released tar ball
make publish
# Clean up the generated files:
make clean
